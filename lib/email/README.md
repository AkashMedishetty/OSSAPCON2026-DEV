## Testing Email Functionality

# Check console logs for email sending status
```

### 2. Test Password Reset

# Visit /auth/forgot-password
# Enter your email address
# Check both inbox and spam folders
```

### 3. Test Admin Bulk Email
```bash
# Login as admin user
# Visit /admin/emails
# Send test email to yourself
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Check if 2FA is enabled
   - Verify app password is correct
   - Ensure no spaces in credentials

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check SMTP host and port
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Try different SMTP port (465 for SSL)

3. **Emails Going to Spam**
   - Set up SPF records for your domain
   - Configure DKIM signing
   - Use a professional from address

### Debug Mode

Enable email debugging by adding:
```bash
DEBUG_EMAIL=true
```

This will log detailed SMTP communication to the console.

## Production Considerations

### 1. Email Service Providers
For production, consider using:
- **SendGrid** - High deliverability
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly
- **AWS SES** - Cost-effective
- **Resend** - Modern alternative

### 2. Rate Limiting
Current settings:
- Batch size: 10 emails per batch
- Delay: 1 second between batches
- Configurable via admin settings

### 3. Monitoring
- Failed email attempts are logged
- Admin dashboard shows email statistics
- Error tracking for troubleshooting

### 4. Security
- Credentials stored as environment variables
- No sensitive data in email logs
- Token-based password reset system
- Email template sanitization

## Configuration Management

Email settings can be managed through:
1. Environment variables (server-level)
2. Admin configuration panel (application-level)
3. Database configuration (dynamic settings)

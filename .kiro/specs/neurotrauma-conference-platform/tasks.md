## Technical Implementation Notes

### Priority Order for Urgent Tasks:
1. **Fix existing website performance issues** (Task 1)
2. **Set up database and basic configuration** (Task 2)
3. **Implement user authentication** (Task 3)
4. **Build payment integration** (Task 5)
5. **Create user dashboard** (Task 4)
6. **Add admin panel** (Task 8)

### Key Dependencies:
- MongoDB Atlas setup must be completed before user authentication
- Payment integration requires Razorpay account setup
- Email system needs email service configuration
- Admin panel depends on user authentication and database setup

### Performance Considerations:
- Implement SSR for all public pages
- Use lazy loading for heavy components (3D models, admin tables)
- Optimize images and implement proper caching
- Bundle splitting for better loading performance

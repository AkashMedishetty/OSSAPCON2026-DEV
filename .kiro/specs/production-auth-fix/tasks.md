  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Enhance middleware token validation for production


  - Fix token detection logic in `middleware.ts` for production cookie names
  - Update `getToken` configuration to match production cookie settings exactly
  - Add proper error handling for token validation failures
  - Implement comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues
  - Fix redirect loop detection and prevention logic
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Fix authentication redirect loop issues


  - Enhance middleware logic to prevent infinite redirects between login and dashboard
  - Fix the redirect guard implementation to work properly in production
  - Add proper referer checking and grace period handling
  - Implement state tracking to avoid redirect loops
  - Test authentication flow to ensure smooth transitions without loops
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Optimize LoginForm component for production


  - Fix production-specific redirect issues in `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
  - Ensure proper session refresh and redirect handling
  - Add better error handling for authentication failures
  - Test login form behavior in production environment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Add production-specific error handling and logging


  - Implement comprehensive error logging for authentication failures
  - Add production debugging information for token validation
  - Create error handling for database connection issues
  - Add monitoring for authentication performance
  - Ensure all console logs are production-appropriate
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Test and validate complete authentication flow


  - Create test scenarios for login, session management, and logout
  - Validate authentication works correctly in production environment
  - Test protected route access and middleware functionality
  - Verify cookie behavior and session persistence
  - Test cross-browser compatibility and mobile authentication
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 10. Deploy and monitor production authentication

  - Deploy fixes to Vercel production environment
  - Monitor authentication logs for any remaining issues
  - Test user login flow in production with real users
  - Validate that all authentication requirements are met
  - Set up monitoring for ongoing authentication health
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1_

- [x] 11. Fix multi-user session conflicts and race conditions





  - Investigate and fix session state conflicts when multiple users login concurrently
  - Resolve rapid session status switching between authenticated/unauthenticated
  - Fix JWT token validation race conditions in middleware and client components
  - Implement proper session isolation to prevent user A's session affecting user B
  - Add session debugging and monitoring for concurrent authentication scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2_
- [x] 12. Fix database session configuration for credentials authentication
  - Fix the critical "Signin in with credentials only supported if JWT strategy is enabled" error
  - Revert to database session strategy with MongoDB adapter as per MULTI_USER_AUTH_SOLUTION.md
  - Implement proper database session callbacks with device-specific session isolation
  - Ensure credentials authentication works correctly with database sessions and MongoDB adapter

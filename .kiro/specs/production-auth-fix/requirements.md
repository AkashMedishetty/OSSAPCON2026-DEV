# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NeuroTrauma 2026 application is experiencing authentication failures in production deployment. Users can successfully authenticate but are immediately redirected back to login, creating an authentication loop. The build process is also failing due to TypeScript errors in the auth configuration. This feature addresses these critical authentication issues to ensure proper user login and session management in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log in successfully in production, so that I can access the dashboard and protected areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect them to the dashboard
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across page navigation
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL allow access without redirecting to login
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login with appropriate callback URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that the application can be deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run build THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the auth configuration is processed THEN the system SHALL use valid NextAuth configuration properties
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks or clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session management in production, so that user authentication is secure and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL use secure cookie settings
2. WHEN handling authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL properly validate and manage JWT tokens
3. WHEN users access the application from different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain separate secure sessions
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error logging for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to avoid authentication redirect loops, so that I can access the application without getting stuck in infinite redirects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware detects an authenticated user THEN the system SHALL not redirect them to login
2. WHEN a user is redirected from login THEN the system SHALL not immediately redirect them back to login
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL handle transitions smoothly without loops
4. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear console logging

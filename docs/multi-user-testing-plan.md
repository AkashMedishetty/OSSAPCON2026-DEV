# Multi-User Authentication Testing Plan

## Test Scenarios to Validate the Fix

### 1. **Basic Multi-User Login Test**
- [ ] User A logs in successfully
- [ ] User B logs in from different browser/device
- [ ] Verify User A's session remains active
- [ ] Verify User B's session is active
- [ ] Both users can access dashboard simultaneously

### 2. **Rapid Concurrent Login Test**
- [ ] 3-5 users attempt to login within 10 seconds
- [ ] Monitor `/api/debug/session-monitor` for conflicts
- [ ] Verify all users can successfully authenticate
- [ ] Check for JWT decryption errors in logs

### 3. **Session Recovery Test**
- [ ] Simulate JWT decryption error (corrupt cookie)
- [ ] Verify automatic recovery mechanism works
- [ ] User should be redirected to login with clear error message
- [ ] Fresh login should work without issues

### 4. **Cross-Browser Test**
- [ ] Login from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Verify sessions don't interfere with each other
- [ ] Test private/incognito mode sessions
- [ ] Verify logout from one browser doesn't affect others

### 5. **Mobile Device Test**
- [ ] Login from mobile browsers
- [ ] Test iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] Verify mobile sessions work alongside desktop sessions

### 6. **Load Test (if possible)**
- [ ] 10+ concurrent users logging in
- [ ] Monitor session monitor API for conflicts
- [ ] Check server logs for JWT errors
- [ ] Verify system stability under load

## Monitoring During Tests

### Debug Endpoints to Monitor:
1. **Session Debug**: `GET /api/debug/session`
   - Check token validity
   - Verify session isolation (different sessionId/deviceId)
   - Monitor cookie behavior

2. **Session Monitor**: `GET /api/debug/session-monitor`
   - Track authentication events
   - Monitor conflict detection
   - Check error rates

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 5%
- **Conflict Count**: Should be 0 after fixes
- **Session Isolation**: Each user should have unique sessionId
- **Recovery Success**: JWT errors should auto-recover

## Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
- No JWT decryption errors in logs
- Multiple users can login simultaneously
- Session state remains stable (no rapid switching)
- Automatic recovery from corrupted sessions
- Clean session isolation between users

### ❌ **Failure Indicators:**
- Continued JWT decryption errors
- One user's login breaks another's session
- Rapid authenticated/unauthenticated switching
- Users getting stuck in redirect loops
- Session conflicts in monitor API

## Fallback Plans if Issues Persist

### Plan A: Database Session Storage
If JWT issues continue, switch to database session storage:
```javascript
session: {
  strategy: 'database',
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
}
```

### Plan B: Redis Session Store
For high-concurrency scenarios:
```javascript
// Use Redis for session storage
// Provides better isolation and performance
```

### Plan C: Separate Auth Service
If NextAuth limitations persist:
- Consider implementing custom auth with proper session isolation
- Use separate microservice for authentication

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build
npm run start

# Monitor session health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/debug/session-monitor

# Clear session monitor data
curl -X DELETE https://your-domain.com/api/debug/session-monitor
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. **Set up alerts** for JWT decryption errors
2. **Monitor session conflict rates** via the session monitor API
3. **Track user authentication success rates**
4. **Set up automated testing** for multi-user scenarios

## Confidence Level

**High Confidence (80-90%)** that the major issues will be resolved:
- JWT decryption errors should be eliminated
- Session conflicts should be prevented
- Multi-user authentication should work

**Medium Confidence (60-70%)** for edge cases:
- Very high concurrency scenarios
- Unusual browser/network conditions
- Complex multi-device scenarios

The solution addresses the root causes, but authentication systems are complex and edge cases can still emerge in production environments.
